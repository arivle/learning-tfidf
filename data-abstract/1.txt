This research aimed to do an extractive sentiment summarization on both positive andnegative sentiment mentioning Indonesian selebrity, Agnes Monica, by combining SentiStrength, Hybrid TF-IDF, and Cosine Similarity. SentiStrength is used to obtain sentiment strength score and classify tweet as a positive, negative or neutral. The summarization of posisitve and negative sentiment can be done by rank tweets using Hybrid TF-IDF summarization and sentiment strength score as additional weight then removing similar tweet by using Cosine Similarity.
The test results showed that the combination of SentiStrength, Hybrid TF-IDF, and Cosine Similarity perform better than using Hybrid TF-IDF only, given an average 60% accuracy and 62% f-measure. This is due to the addition of sentiment score as a weight factor in sentiment summarization.
