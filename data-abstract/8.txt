Hate speech develops along with the rapid development of social media. Hate speech is often issued due to a lack of public awareness of the difference between criticism and statements that might contribute to this crime. Therefore, it is essential to do early detection of sentences written before causing a criminal act due to public ignorance. In this paper, we use the advancement of deep neural networks to predict whether a sentence contains a hate speech and an abusive tone. We demonstrate the robustness of different word and contextual embedding to represent the semantic of hate speech words. In addition, we use a document embedding representation via recurrent neural networks with a gated recurrent unit as the main architecture to provide richer representation. Compared to the syntactic representation of the previous approach, the contextual embedding in our model proved to give a significant boost to the performance by a significant margin.
